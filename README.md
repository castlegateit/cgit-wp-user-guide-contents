# Castlegate IT WP User Guide Contents #

This plugin adds a table of contents to the user guide generated by the [User Guide](http://github.com/castlegateit/cgit-wp-user-guide) plugin. The plugin extracts the text from the first heading found in each user guide section and automatically generates anchors and links for each section.
